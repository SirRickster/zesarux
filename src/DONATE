ZEsarUX is free software and you don't need to pay to use it. 
ZEsarUX will always cost you nothing to use, but that doesn't mean it costs me nothing to make.
So if you want to demonstrate your appreciation to it and also help me cover the costs of my development servers, you can donate using Paypal.
All donors will appear in the DONORS file.
